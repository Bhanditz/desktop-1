The following patches have been added by Opera Software AS and should be
applied when libcurl is upgraded.

1. undef USE_OPENSSL in the file: lib/config-win32.h
   Leaving it defined causes compilation errors due to attempts to use OpenSSL,
   which we don't use on Windows.

2. Remove non-ASCII characters from some source files.
